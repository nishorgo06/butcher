  <div class="text">
    <h1 style="animation-delay: .1s;">Yo, I’m Neelothpol-19, in my last year of college, and just figuring life out like everyone else.&nbsp;</h1>
                              <p style="animation-delay: 0.2s;">I’m into creative things like photography, cinematography, drawing, and sketching when the moment feels right.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p style="animation-delay: 0.3s;">Music’s also a big part of my life-been learning at a place I love, and I did a 3-year basic singing course that kind of opened the door to a whole cultural world for me.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p style="animation-delay: 0.4s;">I’ve always found myself involved in different clubs and volunteering stuff-back in school and still doing it in college. I was also part of this national-level cultural group that used to organize big events every year. Those things taught me a lot, not just about teamwork, but also about people.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p style="animation-delay: 0.5s;">Writing poems, traveling solo, and spending time alone help me stay connected to myself. I’ve been on my own a lot, so sometimes gaming is my way of escaping or just passing time peacefully. I enjoy designing posters and learning random stuff like song production or coding-not because I have to, but because it feels good to build something from scratch. Hopefully, all these little things I love and have experienced add up to something meaningful someday-maybe even something of my own.&nbsp;</p>
                                <p style="animation-delay: 0.6s;">People who match my vibe-not just in energy but in how they feel the world-really stick with me. I like quiet bike rides, hikes, beaches, rainy evenings, cold air, and all those moody little details that give life its charm. Some days I’m outgoing, some days I just keep to myself-somewhere in between feels right. I pay attention to the little things, and they often say more than the big ones.</p>
                                <p style="animation-delay: 0.7s;">I’m truly thankful for my parents-they’ve done so much for me, and I carry that with me every day. Oh, and a small side note: I was born on July 21, my birth certificate randomly says December 21, yeah weird ikr.</p>
                                                                                                                                                            </div>
