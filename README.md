_**Yo, I’m Neelothpol Das, 19 years old and in my last year of college.**_

_**I like exploring creative stuff like photography, cinematography, drawing, and sketching.**_

_**I’m also learning music at a well-known cultural place, and before that, I did a 3-year basic singing course, which helped me get into music and culture.**_

_**I finished high school not long ago. I’ve been pretty active in clubs and events both in school and college.**_

_**I was also part of a national-level cultural group that organizes big events, which gave me some great teamwork and organizing experience.**_

_**Besides that, I enjoy writing poems, traveling solo, and spending quiet time alone. I sometimes go to events and concerts too.**_

_**Since I spend a lot of time by myself, I often play games to keep myself company.**_

_**I also love designing posters and am always learning new things like song producing and coding.**_

_**I dream of running my own business one day, but if that doesn’t work out, I hope my experiences and passions open up new opportunities.**_

_**I vibe with people who really match my vibe—it just feels right, and I enjoy being part of others’ lives—though without forcing it.**_

_**I really love my parents—they’ve done so much to help me grow, and I’m super grateful for them.**_

_**I like hiking mountains, solo riding bike, hitting the beaches, and just being outside. Sometimes I’m outgoing, sometimes I just want my own space.**_

_**I find peace in small moments and love noticing the little things in everyday life.**_

_**July 21 is my birthdate.**_

_**Hit me up on phone, email, Facebook, or Insta anytime — I’m always down to chat or hang out!**_
