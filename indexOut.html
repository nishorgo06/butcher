    Yo I'm Nishorgo XIX. In my last year of college and kinda figuring things out as I go. 
    Passionate about digital and traditional art or any creative things and also snapping random skibidi pics on my phone.

    Obsessed with music plus practicing at a place I luv that hits different. Did a primary level music journey before that. My fam pretty connected to this music culture so itâ€™s runs through me. 

    Been part of different things since school, still rolling with it in college. Used to be in a pretty well known cultural community that threw large scale events and festivals, learned a lot from that. 

    Sometimes I write poems, skate, go on solo trips, hit gym and just chill alone. Since Iâ€™m often by myself, I play games to just kick back my deadaSS and pass the time. Also I like making posters and trying out different stuff like making songs, coding, or whatever else Iâ€™m into. 

    Also lowkey I like bike rides, hikes, beach, rainy nights, cold breezes, and all those chill vibes that make life feel real. Some days out here vibin with everyone, other days just doing my own thing somewhere in the middle.

    Last of all big shoutout to my parents, theyâ€™ve done way too much for me and still got my back, grateful every day for them.

    Here's my email, Fb, or Insta, hit me up if you wanna contact with me.

    Peace<span class="heart">&lt;3</span>
